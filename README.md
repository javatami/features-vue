This project is being developed in concert with the Spring Boot back end to be found here:

[Feature Request Back End] (https://github.com/javatami/wcf)

## Mock Ups

## Assumptions
 - The feature request manager will be integrated into an established security solution. Therefore no login was created.
 - There are additional screens for adding clients.
 - No feature request statuses were requested, therefore I did not add them (though I suspect they would be useful - would ask the users)
 
## To Do:
- Pagination
- Integration Tests
- Accessibility
- Containerize
